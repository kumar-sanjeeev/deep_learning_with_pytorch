# Deep learning with Pytorch

This repository contains all the algorithms code that I am implementing in the pytorch framework for understanding deep learning models.

## Roadmap

## 1) Linear regression Model 
  - ***Problem Statement***:

    Create  model that predicts crop yields for apples and oranges (*target variables*) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall, and humidity (*input variables or features*) in a region. Here's the training data:

  - ***Lessons Learned***
    - linear regression algo
    - importance of loss function for model parameters optimization
    - gradient descent optimization technique
    - model creating and training using pytorch library.
